# Netlist corpus

Differential oracle for the `netlist` row of [docs/dev/testing.md](https://github.com/OpenFAT/Schemify/blob/main/docs/dev/testing.md):
golden netlists produced by *running* a pinned xschem (clean-room, D1) on real
PDK test benches, compared semantically against ours.

Only scripts and the bench list are committed. Everything third-party is
fetched into `.cache/` (gitignored) at pinned revisions; nothing GPL is vendored.

## What is fetched (`fetch.sh`)

Shallow, blob-filtered, sparse checkouts, about 30 MB in total:

The xschem tag matches the binary `golden.sh` runs (nixpkgs `331800d`,
xschem 3.4.7). sky130 model files are not fetched here: open_pdks generates them,
and netlisting only needs their paths. For the ngspice second oracle the nightly
`corpus` job installs a prebuilt open_pdks release with `volare` (pinned in
`.github/workflows/nightly.yml`) and links its `libs.tech/combined`, `libs.tech/ngspice`
and `libs.ref` into `.cache/pdk/sky130A` after `golden.sh`. GF180 models ship as `sm141064.spice`
while the benches reference `sm141064.ngspice` (open_pdks renames them);
rename or symlink before simulating.

## Regenerating

```sh
corpus/fetch.sh          # idempotent; prints commit and size per repo
corpus/golden.sh         # all benches; or a name regex: golden.sh '^ihp-'
corpus/diff_all.sh DIR   # compare DIR/<name>.{spice,cdl} with the goldens
```

`golden.sh` needs `nix` (flakes). Without it, point `XSCHEM=/path/to/xschem`
at an xschem 3.4.7 binary (the sky130 generator bench also needs `tclsh`).

For each line of `benches.txt` (`name rcfile path`) it writes into
`.cache/golden/`:

- `<name>.spice`: the default SPICE netlist (`xschem -x -s` + `xschem netlist`);
- `<name>.cdl`: the LVS netlist, same run with `--tcl 'set lvs_netlist 1'`
  (uses each symbol's `lvs_format`, wraps the top level in `.subckt`, adds
  `*.PININFO`);
- `<name>.{spice,cdl}.log`: xschem output, including its ERC messages between
  `ERC-BEGIN`/`ERC-END` (`undriven node`, `open net`, `shorted output node`);
- `REPORT.txt`: `ok` or `FAIL <reason>` per bench and mode. A missing
  netlist, a crash, or a non-ERC error line (missing symbol, Tcl error) is a
  failure; the script exits 1 if any bench failed.

The rcfiles are generated: the xschem examples get xschem's default library
path re-rooted at the fetched `xschem_library`; PDK benches set
`PDK_ROOT`/`PDK` into the cache and `source` the PDK's own `xschemrc`, so
`SKYWATER_MODELS`, `180MCU_MODELS` and `MODELS_NGSPICE` resolve to cache paths
exactly as they would in a user install. `HOME` points into the cache so no
user `~/.xschem` leaks in.

Note: `xschem -q -n` exits 10 whenever ERC reports anything and prints
nothing; the script netlists through `--script` instead (byte-identical
output) so the ERC text is kept.

## Equivalence (`tools/spicecmp`)

`spicecmp a b` (exit 0 equal, 1 different, 2 usage/I/O) and the library call
`schemify_spicecmp::compare(a, b, &Options) -> Report` treat two netlists as
equivalent when all six sections agree:

1. **Connectivity.** Every subckt defined in the text is flattened; calls to
   undefined subckts (PDK cells) stay leaf devices. The flat device/net graphs
   must be isomorphic under Weisfeiler–Lehman colour refinement, starting from
   device signatures (letter, model, evaluated values and params, `m=1`
   dropped) with terminal order significant. Net names do not matter except
   for anchors: `0`/`gnd`, `.global` names, names ending in `!`, and the
   ports of root subckts (a CDL top cell). Instance names, statement order and
   subckt order never matter.
2. **Params**: top-level `.param` values.
3. **Models**: `.model` cards, params in any order.
4. **Includes**: `.include`/`.lib` lines; paths verbatim after `--alias FROM=TO`
   substitution (`diff_all.sh` aliases the cache directory, so goldens from
   another checkout still compare).
5. **Directives**: all other dot-cards, case-folded, whitespace collapsed.
   `.save` vectors form a set (ngspice saves their union; spacing inside
   `v( x )` dropped); once connectivity matches, a saved net or device is
   spelled by its final WL colour, once per expansion of its subckt, so an
   unnamed net or a save inside a renamed/specialized subckt compares by graph
   position.
6. **Control**: `.control` blocks as text, comment and blank lines dropped.

Numbers are evaluated (SI suffixes, arithmetic over parameters in scope) and
compared to 10 significant digits. An expression that does not evaluate
(B/E/G specs, `pwl` points) is compared as canonical text: numbers
canonicalized and parameter names in scope replaced by their values (SPICE
evaluates them in the instance's scope: `v(a)/ron` with `ron=0.1` *is*
`v(a)/0.1`). Control nodes of B/E/G sources (`v(a,b)` arguments, the `2·N`
nodes after `poly(N)`/`pwl(N)`/`and(N)`/…) and the extra bare nodes of CDL
multi-terminal R/C/D are terminals, not text. A subckt call's scope follows
ngspice 45: top-level `.param`s, then the call's overrides, then the subckt's
other defaults evaluated after them (`r='w*l'` sees the call's `w`); a bare word
after a `.subckt` line's parameters (`delay=200 ps`) is ignored, as ngspice
ignores it (both checked by running ngspice 45). Known blind spots: 1-WL cannot
separate some highly regular graphs (it also lets a `.save` of one of two
automorphic nets match the other), and F/H/K references keep instance names as
text.

`--bind-free` (`Options::bind_free`, off for the oracle) treats names the
first netlist uses but never defines at its top level as free parameters,
binds them to the values the second netlist uses (its same-named `.param`,
else the same-named device's value in the same slot, or the solution of an
expression affine in one free name) and compares everything under that one
binding. The corpus reports pairs equal only this way as
"golden-unevaluated" (RATCHET.md), never as agreement.

Self-tests: `cargo test -p schemify-spicecmp` (metamorphic proptests:
shuffled lines, renamed nets/instances/subckts, reordered subckts, respelled
numbers and case compare equal; one moved connection or one changed value
compares different; arbitrary text never panics and comparison is reflexive
and symmetric; each equivalence above has a case and its negative in
`save_sets_expression_params_and_free_bindings`). With goldens present, `-- --include-ignored` also shuffles
every golden and checks that dropping a device is always detected.
