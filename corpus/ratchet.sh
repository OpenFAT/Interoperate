# <TABLE.md> is what `tests/xschem_differential.rs` writes into
# `.cache/netlist-out/`. Both files hold the same per-set table (`| set | mode | agree | … |`):
# the gated numbers are the SPICE agree count (column 3 of the `spice` rows) and the CDL agree
# count against the code-stripped golden (column 7 of the `cdl` rows), summed over sets.
# Exit 1 when either is below the recorded value; a higher value asks for RATCHET.md to be
# raised in the change that earned it.
