# Live Virtuoso test kit

One command that tells you whether the interop plugin works on a real Cadence Virtuoso. It
drives Virtuoso in batch mode through every path the plugin offers, grades the results and
writes a report that ends in a verdict: **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**, **PASS on everything tested**
(when optional areas were left out), or **NOT FULLY FUNCTIONAL** with the failing checks.

Everything the kit creates goes into libraries whose names start with `sfy` under its own work
directory. It never writes to your libraries: your own cells (`--cell`) are only read, then
copied into scratch libraries.

## Requirements

On the machine that runs Virtuoso:

- Virtuoso on `PATH`, and a `cds.lib` that defines `analogLib` and `basic`. Your usual project directory has one.
- This repository with its submodules, and the Rust toolchain (`rustup`, installable in your
  home directory without root). The kit's host steps are a Rust test of this crate. The first
  run compiles it, which takes a few minutes.
- Optional, each enables more checks: `si` (netlists), `ocean` and `spectre` (simulation). The
  kit finds them on `PATH` and reports SKIP for what it could not run.

Before the run, close every Virtuoso window on the machine's `sfy*` libraries (there are none
on a first run). If your site's Virtuoso start-up shows a dialog (licence level, PDK first use),
answer it once in an interactive session with "Always", since batch mode has nobody to click.

## Run it

From your Virtuoso project directory (the one with `cds.lib`):

`test.sh` is the shortest way: it starts clean, runs everything with the flags you give it, and
writes what to send back into `sfylive/summary.txt`:

```sh
/path/to/Schemify-Interop/live/test.sh --lib sample
```

`run.sh` alone does the same without the cleanup and the summary:

```sh
/path/to/Schemify-Interop/live/run.sh
```

That runs the fixtures only, with no PDK. To cover everything, add your own cells and a PDK:

```sh
/path/to/Schemify-Interop/live/run.sh \
    --lib myLib --project ~/designs/my_schemify_project \
    --cell myLib/amp --cell myLib/amp_tb \
    --pdk myPdk/nfet --callbacks
```

| Flag | Adds |
|---|---|
| `--lib LIB` | A whole Virtuoso library, repeatable: every cell is dumped, imported into Schemify, exported again, loaded into a scratch library and dumped there, and the two dumps must agree. This is the "move my project to Schemify and back" check. |
| `--project DIR` | A whole Schemify project, repeatable: it gets everything the fixture projects get (both export modes, the load, the dump back, the exact round trip). This is the "move my Schemify project to Virtuoso and back" check. |
| `--cell LIB/CELL` | Your own cell, repeatable. It gets the self-test and the full round trip (Virtuoso to Schemify to Virtuoso). Use one cell with PDK transistors and one testbench with a maestro view. |
| `--pdk LIB[/CELL[,CELL…]]` | The PDK mirror: every device of `LIB` dumped and imported as Schemify cells. The cells named, and every cell of `LIB` that your `--cell`/`--lib` schematics or `--project` designs instantiate, are characterized. The first cell named is also the probe's transistor (its CDF and callbacks are recorded). |
| `--callbacks` | Loads your `--cell` cells again with the PDK's CDF callbacks running, as the Edit Properties form runs them. |
| `--env FILE` | A csh file that sets up Cadence (your site's `cadence.csh`): the kit sources it through csh and runs with that environment, so `test.sh --env cadence.csh …` works from bash or over `ssh host '…'` without sourcing anything first. |
| `--cdslib FILE` | Another `cds.lib` (default `./cds.lib`). |
| `--work DIR` | Where everything goes (default `./sfylive`). The Virtuoso libraries live in `DIR/libs`. |
| `--step STEP` | Runs one step (below) instead of all. |

Environment: `SFYLIVE_VIRTUOSO` replaces the Virtuoso command (default
`virtuoso -nograph -restore`), and `SFYLIVE_TIMEOUT` the seconds a session may take (default
3600).

When it finishes, read `sfylive/out/report.md` and send back `sfylive/sfylive-results.tgz`.
The archive holds the report, the probe output, every log and every dump. The probe lines and
your cells' dumps can contain PDK parameter names; remove what you cannot share.

## What it does

| Step | Runs | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `prepare` | Rust | Exports five Schemify fixture projects to `.sfyx` twice: with core devices as `schemify_core` cells, and on analogLib masters (the default). Writes the OCEAN scripts, damaged copies for the refusal checks, and `session1.il`. |
| `session1` | Virtuoso | Checks that every entry point and Cadence function the bridge calls exists, runs the probe, loads every export, dumps each library back, runs `SfySelfTest`, loads dumps that the SKILL dumper wrote and dumps them again, tries the refusals, and runs your cells and the PDK. |
| `tools` | si, OCEAN | Netlists the RC fixture and your cells with Virtuoso's own netlisters (Spectre and auCdl), and runs the exported OCEAN scripts of the RC bench in Spectre. |
| `mid` | Rust | Imports the dumps, edits one instance in Schemify, exports again, and writes `session2.il`. |
| `session2` | Virtuoso | Loads that export over the first load, edits one instance parameter in Virtuoso, dumps it, and sends your cells back through a scratch library. |
| `verify` | Rust | Grades everything into `out/report.md`. |

If cargo and Virtuoso are on different machines, run the steps one by one (`--step`) with the
work directory at the same absolute path on both, for example on a shared disk.

## The checks

| Check | Passes when |
|---|---|
| `env.entry-points`, `env.cadence-functions` | `schemify.il` loads, and this release has every Cadence function the bridge calls. |
| `probe.sections` | Every probe section ran. A WARN lists the sections that raised an error: they settle the open questions of spec §13, so send the file back either way. |
| `load.<project>.<mode>` | `SfyImport` loaded the export with nothing refused, and every schematic passed `schCheck` (`schcheck.*` lists the errors otherwise). |
| `maestro.rclive.*` | The bench came with its maestro view. |
| `dump.*` | `SfyExport` dumped every library back. |
| `roundtrip.p_<dir>.*` | The same two round trips for each `--project`. |
| `roundtrip.<project>.core` | The dumps import to the original Schemify files byte for byte. This is the exact round trip of spec §7.4. |
| `roundtrip.<project>.alib` | On analogLib masters, every bench netlists the same before and after Virtuoso. |
| `dumpfix.*` | Dumps that the SKILL dumper wrote load and dump back to the same records, covering every shape kind, label kind, bus, net expression and text view. |
| `selftest.*` | `SfySelfTest` (dump, load, dump) agrees on a loaded cell. |
| `refuse.*` | A truncated or malformed file is refused and creates nothing, an existing view needs `?overwrite`, and a cellview open for editing is never rewritten. |
| `team.kept-unchanged` | Cellviews nobody edited in Schemify stay exactly as Virtuoso drew them (spec §7.5). |
| `team.edits-arrive` | A Schemify edit reaches Virtuoso, a Virtuoso edit comes back to Schemify, and nothing else changes. |
| `analoglib.table.<cell>` | The analogLib this Virtuoso has puts its pins where the plugin's table says (export places re-mastered devices by that table). |
| `align.<device>.<cell>` | Whether a core device's pins line up with the analogLib cell's: PASS means no stubs; INFO rows name devices with another pin pattern, which keep stubs. |
| `align.rclive.no-stubs` | The RC bench exported on analogLib masters came back from Virtuoso without a single stub. |
| `netlist.<sim>.<lib>.<cell>` | Virtuoso's netlister writes a netlist of the loaded cell. |
| `netlist.cdl-matches-aucdl` | Schemify's CDL of the RC section equals Virtuoso's auCdl. A WARN shows the difference, which settles GUESS G7. |
| `ocean.rclive.<mode>.*` | The exported OCEAN script runs in Spectre and gives tau = RC = 1 ms and v(out) at 1 ms = 1 − 1/e, both within 1 %. |
| `user.*` | Your cell (or with `--lib`, your whole library, as `user.*.<lib>.ALL`) passes the self-test, imports into Schemify with every file loading, and goes back to Virtuoso and dumps to the same records. |
| `user.callbacks-run.*` | No CDF callback failed. INFO rows list the values the PDK clamped or derived. |
| `pdk.import` | The PDK mirror imports and every device cell loads. |
| `pdk.characterize`, `pdk.derived` | With `--pdk`: `SfyCharacterize` finds each covered device's inputs by experiment and measures what its CDF callbacks derive (spec §8.3) into `out/pdk_char.sfyx`, which stays on your machine; `pdk.derived` (one row per device) names the netlisted parameters that change with the inputs. |
| `pdk.rules.<lib>.<cell>` | The characterization's rules (spec §8.3) applied to the imported mirror in `projects/pdk`: PASS when every derived parameter has a rule that reproduces every measured point and every rewritten input has a legality rule (`valid on (…)`); WARN names the parameters left to Virtuoso's values (`vderived`, cached per instance) or the inputs whose rewrites follow no rule. |
| `pdk.holdout.<lib>.<cell>`, `pdk.rules.check.<lib>.<cell>` | Session 2 measures the device at three points the characterization never covered (other multiples of each number input's default, counts 5 6 7, other boolean and choice values) and every rule must predict the callbacks' values there within the digits they printed, and every legality rule must hold exactly where they kept the value; the detail gives the worst error per rule, no values. |

## Known differences

- A circle whose box is off Virtuoso's grid (whole DBUs, 1/160 inch) is stored with its box
  rounded outward, so Virtuoso draws it slightly elliptic. A Schemify file whose circles were
  untouched in Virtuoso gets them back exactly from the stash.
- A docs-page variable computed by a plugin (the OTA's `W W_in` with `gmid.w(...)`) has no
  Virtuoso form, so Virtuoso gets the device's default width. The width comes back from the
  stash.

- With `--lib`, a cell's CDF comes back exactly as it was while nobody changed the cell's
  pins, params or impls in Schemify (the `vcdf` reverse stash). After such an edit, export
  derives the CDF again and can add netlisting siminfo keys (`instParameters`, an auCdl
  entry), a `netSet` param for each pin with a net expression, and an empty string param
  for each name a symbol label shows. The check accepts these additions and counts the
  cells; anything the original CDF had and the copy lacks fails.

## How the kit is tested

`tests/virtuoso_live.rs` runs the whole kit against the mock Virtuoso of `tests/skill` (the
same interpreter and database model the plugin's other tests use) in `kit_passes_on_the_mock`,
and `--lib` on the mock's fixture library in `kit_lib_round_trip_on_the_mock`.
Every check passes there except the known failures above, and only si, OCEAN and the optional
areas are skipped. So a failure on a real Virtuoso means Virtuoso behaves differently from our
reading of its manuals; it does not point at the kit. `sfy_live.il` is parsed by the same
SKILL reader that gates the shipped scripts.

The `si.env` keys and the `si -batch` calls (`-command nl` for Spectre, `-command netlist`
plus the CDL Out form's keys for auCdl, both checked on ICADVM20.1) are not covered by the
mock. If the netlist checks fail with an si usage error, the log is in `out/netlist/*.log`.
